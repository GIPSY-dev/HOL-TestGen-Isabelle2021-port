Title: Error in the delete operation red-black trees used for finite sets
======
Keyword: finite sets
========

SML/NJ Version Number: 110.44
======================

Severity: Major
=========

Description:
============
The delete operation of the red-black tree implementation used for finite maps 
and sets returns binary search trees that are violating the red-black tree 
invariants, i.e. it returns trees that are not balanced.
This bug does not result in data loss, it only affects the runtime behavior
of the finite set (map) implementation. In the worst case, delete returns 
a linear list instead of a valid red-black tree.

Note that we have proofed the correctness of the insertion function formally using 
Isabelle/HOL. If you are interested, we could send you our formalization of 
the SML/NJ red-black trees together with the proof scripts. We discovered this 
bug when we used our HOL formalization of the SML red-black tree implementation 
as a case study for a specification-based test data generation method described
in [1]. You can also find a more visual description of the bug in this document.

SML source code to reproduce the bug:
=====================================
(* load the content of sml-lib/Util/int-redblack-set.sml
   into the interpreter and make all of its definition available
   to the top-level environment, then execute
 *)

Control.Print.printDepth:=100;
val s=add(empty,5);
val s=add(s,6);
val s=add(s,8);
val s=add(s,2);
val s=delete(s,8);


Transcript of execution demonstrating the bug:
===============================================
- val s=add(empty,5);
val s = SET (1,T (R,E,5,E)) : set
- val s=add(s,6);
val s = SET (2,T (B,E,5,T (R,E,6,E))) : set
- val s=add(s,8);
val s = SET (3,T (R,T (B,E,5,E),6,T (B,E,8,E))) : set
- val s=add(s,2);
val s = SET (4,T (B,T (B,T (R,E,2,E),5,E),6,T (B,E,8,E))) : set
- val s=delete(s,8);
val s = SET (3,T (B,E,2,T (B,T (R,E,5,E),6,E))) : set
(* correct result should be:
    s = SET (3,T (B,(B,E,2,E),5,(B,E,6,E)) : set
 *)

Additional comments:
====================
We tested (for simplicity) the IntRedBlackSet implementation, but the other
redblack-tree variants, e.g. word-redblack-set.sml are also affected by
this bug.
